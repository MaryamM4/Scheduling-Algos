## Scheduling Algorithms Self-Assessment

1. First-come, first-servered (5/5):
       Tasks are executed in the order they arrive, 
       with the correct execution time printed after each task completes. 
       The task order is determined by lexicographical order (for hw's sake).

2. Shortest-job-first (5/5):
       Prioritizes tasks by shortest CPU burst.

3. Priority Scheduling (5/5)
       Schedules tasks based on priority.

4. Round-Robin (5/5)
       Each task runs for quantum of 10 ms and then 
       returns to end of queue when not done.

5. Priority with Round-Robin (5/5)
       Creates Round-Robin "rings" for tasks with same priority,
       and the rings and organized by priority level.
  
Bonus: Output CPU Utilization (2/2)
       Calculates CPU utilization as execution time divided by
       the time passed since CPU init. 
       
       Note the assignment assumes all tasks arrive at the same time,
       and the CPU is not left in an idle state.

Bonus: Output TAT, WT, RT for each sheduling algorithm (1/3)
       (Turn Around Time, Wait Time, Response Time).
              Works only for fcfs right now.

Total Score: 20/20 (basic reqs) + Bonus 3/5 = 28/25
